## Question 1
**What is the Feynman Technique?**  
The Feynman Technique is a learning method where you understand a topic by explaining it in simple words as if teaching someone else.

## Question 2
**Most interesting idea from Barbara Oakley’s video**

## Question 3
**Active (Focused) and Diffused Modes of Thinking**

- **Active / Focused mode:** When we concentrate deeply on a specific task such as solving coding problems, reading technical concepts, or debugging.
- **Diffused mode:** When the mind is relaxed (walking, resting, showering), allowing the brain to connect ideas and find creative solutions.

## Question 4
**Steps to take when approaching a new topic (Learn Anything in 20 Hours)**

1. Break the skill into smaller sub-skills.
2. Learn enough to self-correct mistakes.
3. Remove distractions during practice.
4. Practice the skill for at least 20 focused hours.

## Question 5

- Practice explaining concepts in my own words after learning.
- Take notes during learning and review them regularly.
- Implement concepts in small coding exercises or projects.
