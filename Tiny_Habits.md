# Tiny Habits and Atomic Habits -- Reflection Answers

## Question 1

The most interesting idea for me is starting habits very small. When we
start with tiny actions, it becomes easy to continue daily and slowly it
becomes a big habit.

## Question 2

B = MAP means behavior happens when **Motivation, Ability and Prompt**
come together.\
Motivation means interest, Ability means how easy the task is, and
Prompt means reminder. If the task is easy and we have a reminder,
habits become easier.

## Question 3

Celebrating after doing a habit is important because it gives happiness.
When we feel happy after doing something, our brain wants to repeat it
again and the habit becomes strong.

## Question 4

The idea I liked most is improving **1% every day**. Small improvements
daily can give big results in the future.

## Question 5

The book says habits are related to identity. When we believe "I am a
person who studies daily," we automatically try to follow that behavior.

## Question 6

To make a habit easier, we should start small, make the task simple, and
prepare everything in advance so it becomes easy to do daily.

## Question 7

To make a habit harder, we should remove reminders, make the process
difficult, and add extra steps so we avoid doing it often.

## Question 8

One habit I want to do more is **daily studying**. I will keep my books
ready, study at the same time every day, and track my progress.

## Question 9

One habit I want to reduce is **mobile usage**. I will turn off
notifications, keep my phone away while studying, and set screen-time
limits.
